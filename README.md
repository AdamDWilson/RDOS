Risk Data Open Standards Schema Repo

Risk Data Open Standard (RDOS)
1/31/2020
WHAT IS THE RDOS?
The Risk Data Open Standard (RDOS) is a logical data model and data specification used to express and exchange risks for any line of business in a consistent manner. It is a modern data schema for the risk modeling community, representing the new standard for holding all types of risk data, including exposure, coverage, model settings, and results of analyses. Purpose-built for the risk industry, RDOS is a “living” open standard guided by real-world practitioners who need improved interoperability and portability to support modern risk management. RDOS will evolve over time to support current and emerging requirements in the risk modeling industry.
RDOS has been developed by Risk Management Solutions (RMS) with guidance from the RDOS Steering Committee, composed of experts from 15 leading insurance companies, to provide a much-needed industry data standard. RDOS solves many pain-points that modeling practitioners have struggled with for decades and it paves the way for the future of risk modeling. RDOS is a data specification and is agnostic of any database technology. This enables industry to implement RDOS on different technology that suits their access patterns, performance and scale needs.
